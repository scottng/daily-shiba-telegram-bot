## Setup
A Telegram account is required to setup and use the bot. Send a message to @BotFather on Telegram to create a new bot account. After choosing a name and URL, BotFather will generate a **bot token**, which is a secret token that will be used to control the bot.

Clone the repo and create **config.py**. Inside of **config.py**, put `BOT_TOKEN='your_token_here'`.

## How to run
In a command line, run `python3 bot.py`. To shut down the bot, press `CTRL + C`.
